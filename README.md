I was developed this mobile application as my final year project during my degree studies.

It's a powerful Android network scanning mobile application that mainly focused on the pentester, which combines necessary functions for the user to conduct network scanning.

It allows the user to conduct several functions such as :-

- Host Discovery
- Port Scanning 
- Vulnerability Scanning
- Wi-Fi password cracking (Dictionary attack)
- Internet Speed Testing
- Manage User Profile

## Prerequisite

- Rooted Android Device
- Download & install the Nmap binary file on your rooted Android device

## Before we get started

we need to download & import some certain files for the database and server-side scripting to make it run smoothly.
